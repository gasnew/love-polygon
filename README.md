# Love Polygon

Engage in a battle of deception, wit, and (mostly) unrequited love in this fun throwback to middle school romance.

## The Rules of Engagement

Love Polygon is a hidden identity game where each player is provided three important facts:

1. What you need to end the round (3 of `cookie`, `cake`, or `candy`)

2. Who you have a relationship with--`crush` or `wingman`

3. The needs of the object of affection of that relationship, e.g., I am Jimmy's wingman, and Jimmy's crush needs `candy`.

### The Points Do Matter
In Love Polygon, the objective is to obtain the most points. And of course, the
best way to maximize your points is to manipulate other people to give you
information. Points are awarded as follows:

**1 point** for getting your needs met

**2 points** for meeting the needs of your `crush` or the crush of the person
for whom you are a `wingman`. You will not receive these points if the object
of affection guesses all of the people who have a crush on them exactly

**3 points** for guessing all of the people who have a crush on you exactly. It
could be zero people :(

### Round Format
A game round proceeds in three phases:
* The *lobby*, where you put your heart in the love bucket to say you're ready
* The *romance* period, where you trade goods to win each other's hearts
* The *reckoning*, where players silently guess all of the other players who have a crush on them

The relationships are generated according to two rules:
1. You either have a `crush` or are someone's `wingman`
2. You cannot be a `wingman` for someone who has a `crush` on you

There are always enough resources for everyone to have their needs met.
